## 🔍 About Me

I’ve been researching blockchain technology since 2019, with a deep interest in governance mechanisms, incentive structures, and critical review processes. My work centers around improving transparency and accountability within decentralized funding systems, especially through Project Catalyst — Cardano's on-chain innovation fund.

I'm also the founder of [Agora](https://github.com/Rodrigopacini/agora), an initiative focused on applying critical thinking to governance processes in the Cardano ecosystem.
